			Web Security is very important nowadays. Websites are always prone to security threats/risks.
			Web Security deals with the security of data over the internet/network or web or while it is being transferred to the internet. 
			For e.g. when you are transferring data between client and server and you have to protect that data that security of data is your web security.
			Hacking a Website may result in the theft of Important Customer Data, it may be the credit card information or the login details of a customer or it can be the destruction
			of one’s business and propagation of illegal content to the users while somebody hacks your website they can either steal the important information of the customers or they can even propagate
			the illegal content to your users through your website so, therefore, security considerations are needed in the context of web security.<br />

			<h3>Security Threats:</h3>
			A Threat is nothing but a possible event that can damage and harm an information system. Security Threat is defined as a risk that which, can potentially harm Computer systems & organizations. 
			Whenever an Individual or an Organization creates a website, they are vulnerable to security attacks.
			Security attacks are mainly aimed at stealing altering or destroying a piece of personal and confidential information, stealing the hard drive space, and illegally accessing passwords. 
			So whenever the website you created is vulnerable to security attacks then the attacks are going to steal your data alter your data destroy your personal information see your confidential information and also it accessing your password.
			<h3>Top Web Security Threats :</h3>
			Web security threats are constantly emerging and evolving, but many threats consistently appear at the top of the list of web security threats. These include:<br /><br />
			&emsp;Cross-site scripting (XSS)<br />
			&emsp;SQL Injection<br />
			&emsp;Phishing Ransomware<br />
			&emsp;Code Injection<br />
			&emsp;Viruses and worms<br />
			&emsp;Spyware<br />
			&emsp;Denial of Service<br />
			<h3>Security Consideration:</h3>

			Updated Software: You need to always update your software. 
			Hackers may be aware of vulnerabilities in certain software, which are sometimes caused by bugs and can be used to damage your computer system and steal personal data. Older versions of software can become a gateway for hackers to enter your network. 
			Software makers soon become aware of these vulnerabilities and will fix vulnerable or exposed areas. That’s why It is mandatory to keep your software updated, It plays an important role in keeping your personal data secure.</h3>
			<h3>Beware of SQL Injection:</h3>
			SQL Injection is an attempt to manipulate your data or your database by inserting a rough code into your query. For e.g. somebody can send a query to your website and this query 
			can be a rough code while it gets executed it can be used to manipulate your database such as change tables, modify or delete data or it can retrieve important information also so, one should be aware of the SQL injection attack.</h3>
			<h3>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</h3>
			XSS allows the attackers to insert client-side script into web pages. E.g. Submission of forms. It is a term used to describe a class of attacks that allow an attacker to inject client-side scripts into other 
			users’ browsers through a website. As the injected code enters the browser from the site, the code is reliable and can do things like sending the user’s site authorization cookie to the attacker.

			</div>
			<h3>Error Messages:</h3>
			You need to be very careful about error messages which are generated to give the information to the users while users access the website and some error messages are generated due to one or another reason and you should be 
			very careful while providing the information to the users. For e.g. login attempt – If the user fails to login the error message should not let the user know which field is incorrect: Username or Password.</h3>
			<h3>Data Validation:</h3>
			Data validation is the proper testing of any input supplied by the user or application. It prevents improperly created data from entering the information system. Validation of data should be performed 
			on both server-side and client-side. If we perform data validation on both sides that will give us the authentication. Data validation should occur when data is received from an outside party, especially if the data is from untrusted sources.</h3>
			<h3>Password:</h3>
			<img src="hacker2.gif", align="right" height=200 width=355 vspace="5" hspace="30">
			Password provides the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your device and personal information. It is necessary to use a strong password. Hackers in many cases use sophisticated software that uses brute force to crack passwords. 
			Passwords must be complex to protect against brute force. It is good to enforce password requirements such as a minimum of eight characters long must including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numerals.<br />
